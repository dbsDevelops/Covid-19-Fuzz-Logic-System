# Covid-19 Fuzzy Logic System
In this repository, we create a fuzzy logic system to detect to likeliness of a patient to have COVID-19 based on their symptoms. It is important to note that real-life scenarios where not tested against this system. All of the rules where based on research carried out through the project which is referenced at the end of the notebook.
